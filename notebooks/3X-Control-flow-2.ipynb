The easy and useless response is that is not how it works. A more appropriate answer is that by controlling the flow of a script we can have much shorter loops, more readible code, and importantly, more flexible code. What all of this means and how to apply it is the aim of this notebook.\n",

    "x = 1\n",
    "y = 2\n",
    "x == y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If ```x``` is equal to ```y``` True will be returned otherwise False. Here ```x``` and ```y``` are the ```==``` are an operator.  Any boolean expresion have this structure of two operands compared with an operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator can be one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x == y # x is equal to y\n",
    "x != y # x is not equal to y\n",
    "x > y # x is greater than y\n",
    "x < y # x is less than y\n",

    "x is y # x is the same as y\n",
    "x is not y # x is not the same as y\n",
