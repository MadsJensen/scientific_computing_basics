# Introduction to scientific computing and data science

The materials in this repository were compiled for the course "C268/01: _Foundations of data-driven health science_", developed for the Graduate School of Health Sciences, Aarhus University, Denmark.

## Learning objectives

* Summarize how the main components of a computer relate to, and constrain, the act of "computing".
* Describe the basic organisation of a file system, and navigate it using commands in a "terminal".
* Contrast _textual_ and _binary_ files in terms of their contents and find information in both using tools that can be automated.
* Contrast local and non-local computing resources and file systems, and formulate use cases for both.
* Use _variables_ in a programming language (python) and perform simple operations (manipulations) on the information (data) they contain.
* Write a program to extract, collate and preprocess "raw" data for further processing (statistics, visualisation, _etc._).

## Prerequisites

* a personal computer < 5 years old, with
  * a 64-bit operating system (Windows, Mac or Linux)
  * administrative privileges (password)
  * minimum 20 GB free disk space
* internet access

## How to use the materials

Most of the materials are written as [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html). Reading and executing these require successful installation of a particular [_software environment_](html/software-environments.html).

You can browse through the materials in static form (_i.e._ without being able to execute any code) on the [GitHub repository-pages](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/scientific_computing_basics).

To get started, [go to the overview-notebook](notebooks/01-Course-Overview.ipynb) and follow the links.
